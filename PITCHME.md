## Procedural Programming

Note:
A call decouples from
- registers and
- variables and state in the calling procedure.

A procedure can be called from and reused anywhere.

This is still used a lot esp. for utility functions.

## Object Oriented Programming

Note:
- A class encapsulates functionality and state.
- Thus it decouples from other classes.
- Inheritence creates a lot of coupling.
- OOP works best for purely technical domains.
- It grew strong together with GUIs.
