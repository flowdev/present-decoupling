# Decoupling and Code
<h2 class="fragment">Or: Decoupling Through the Ages</h2>

Dear community,
as we all know in the beginning there was chaos and then came ...

## Procedural Programming

Note:
I hope I didn't hurt anyones religious feelings. I just love such jokes.

## Procedural Programming (2)

In the beginning there was chaos:
- ANYTHING was done to save memory |
- Modifiying code at runtime |
- No chance to reason about the code |

---

## Procedural Programming (3)

Then came procedures:
- they give structure to the program |
- they decouple from registers |
- they decouple from state in the calling procedure |
- a procedure can be called from and reused anywhere |
- possible to reuse procedures across projects |
- this is still used a lot esp. for utility functions |

## Object Orientation
![Logo](assets/class-diagram.jpg)

Note:
- It grew strong together with GUIs.
- A class encapsulates functionality and state.
- Thus it decouples from other classes.
- Inheritence creates a lot of coupling.
- OOP works best for purely technical domains.

## Clean Code

Note:
- Favour Composition over Inheritance
- Separation of Concerns
- Information Hiding Principle
- Tell, donÂ´t ask! (High cohesion)
- Dependency injection
- SOLID principles!!!
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open Closed Principle: software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle: many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Dependency Inversion Principle: one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions

## Messaging

Note:
- Why don't we use HTTP internaly?
- Asynchronism prevents time wise coupling (no timeout handling).
- Persistence prevents stability wise coupling (no exponential backoff that has to be randomised, no circuit breaker).
- Sender and receiver are decoupled with messaging.

## Functional Programming

Note:
- Functors (higher-order functions) allow composition of decoupled functions.
- Immutable data structures decouple concurrently running functions.
- Pure (side-effect free) functions are decoupled from any context including timing (lazy evaluation).
- Especially good for multithreading

## Optimize for Decoupling

- Decoupling as a natural thing to happen |
- Good match for business logic           |
- Easy to understand (low cognitive load) |
- Natural graphical representation        |
